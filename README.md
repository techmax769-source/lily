### 🌹 Of This Work

> This humble craft be not mere script and style,  
> But a token wrought of love, by gentle guile.  
> In every shimmer, in every hue —  
> Dwelleth mine heart, devoted unto **thee**, my sweetest Lilian Gatwiri 💫

Thee shalt find not lines of logic nor dull code,  
But the whisper of fondness, the glow of the moon,  
And the rhythm of affection that never doth fade. 💗

### 💫 Whence Its Enchantment Lies

💖 **Animated Declarations:**  
Soft glimmers and tender motion that mirror the pulse of love.

🎵 **Melody Enchanted:**  
A song that breathes and fades, returning anon — endless as devotion.

✨ **Lyrics That Awaken:**  
Each verse doth appear in time’s embrace, singing gently with the tune.

🌙 **Graceful Motion:**  
Every sparkle, every fade, doth move like sighs upon the night air.

### 🌷 A Note to Her

> *When this page unfoldeth its light,*  
> *Know, beloved, it be not mere design —*  
> *But the beating of my soul upon the screen.*  
>  
> *Each letter whispereth thy name,*  
> *Each color remembereth thy smile.*  
>  
> **Forever thine — in code, in heart, in time. 💞**
