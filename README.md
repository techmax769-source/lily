### 🌹 Of This Work

> This humble craft be not mere script and style,  
> But a token wrought of love, by gentle guile.  
> In every shimmer, in every hue,  
> Dwelleth mine heart — devoted unto **thee**, my sweetest **Lilian Gatwiri 💫**

Thou shalt find not logic nor machine,  
But the pulse of love made visible between lines unseen.  
A soft enchantment breathing through sound and glow —  
The soul’s confession in digital flow. 💗

### 💫 Whence Its Enchantment Lies

💖 **Animated Declarations:**  
Soft glimmers and tender motions that mirror the pulse of love.  

🎵 **Melody Enchanted:**  
A song that breathes, fades, and riseth again — endless as devotion.  

✨ **Lyrics That Awaken:**  
Each verse revealeth itself in time’s embrace, whispering softly with the tune.  

🌙 **Graceful Motion:**  
Every sparkle, every fade, doth move like sighs upon the night air.

### 🌷 A Note to Her

> *When this page unfoldeth its light,*  
> *Know, beloved, it be not mere design —*  
> *But the beating of my soul upon the screen.*  
>  
> *Each letter whispereth thy name,*  
> *Each color remembereth thy smile.*  
>  
> **Forever thine — in code, in heart, in time. 💞**
